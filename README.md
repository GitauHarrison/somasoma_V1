# E-learning site

My intention with this project is to record my ideas on how to go about creating an e-learning site for school-attending learners. The focus is physical computing for now.

It will have a student side and a teacher side. The teacher uploads content and he or she can monitor the progress of the student.

It is more less an **online school concept**.

Initial design was done on figma, and can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/uG0hCD0uuAYbWZIhjf6fPz/somasoma-student-front-end-_Version-1?node-id=2%3A1&scaling=scale-down)
